    "   - The game progresses through player arguments and umpire adjudication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Turns and Rounds:**\n",
    "   - The game consists of several rounds.\n",
    "   - In each round, players take turns making arguments for actions they wish to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Arguments:**\n",
    "   - Players describe their intended action, the desired outcome, and provide a rationale.\n",
    "   - Arguments should be plausible within the context of the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjudication:**\n",
    "   - The Umpire evaluates each argument for plausibility and potential impact.\n",
    "   - Outcomes are determined based on the strength of the argument and the current game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resources:**\n",

    "   - Resource management affects the plausibility of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Conflict Resolution:**\n",
    "   - When arguments oppose each other, the Umpire resolves the conflict, possibly using dice rolls to introduce uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **International Reaction:**\n",
    "   - Actions may trigger responses from international actors.\n",
    "   - The Umpire will introduce events based on player actions (e.g., sanctions, interventions).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Winning the Game:**\n",
    "   - There is no single winner; success is measured by how well factions achieve their objectives.\n",
    "   - The game may conclude when a stable resolution is reached or tensions escalate beyond control.\n",

    "9. **Umpire Role:**\n",

    "Nuclear Tensions between East and West\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world reminiscent of the late Cold War, two superpowers, EAST and WEST, stand on the brink of nuclear conflict. Both nations possess significant military might and nuclear arsenals. Within each nation, the Military and Economic Divisions play crucial roles in shaping policy and strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EAST Military Division** aims to protect the nation from external threats and demonstrate strength to deter the WEST.\n",
    "- **EAST Economic Division** focuses on expanding the nation's economic influence and securing resources.\n",
    "- **WEST Military Division** seeks to safeguard the nation by showcasing military prowess and preventing aggression from the EAST.\n",
    "- **WEST Economic Division** strives to enhance economic growth and stability, minimizing the impact of potential conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game simulates the delicate balance of power, with players making arguments for actions that could either escalate or de-escalate tensions. The Umpire adjudicates outcomes based on plausibility and the evolving game state.\n",

    "Game Rules: Nuclear Tensions between East and West\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective:**\n",
    "   - Each faction aims to achieve its strategic objectives while managing tensions to prevent nuclear conflict.\n",
    "   - The game progresses through player arguments and umpire adjudication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Turns and Rounds:**\n",
    "   - The game consists of several rounds.\n",
    "   - In each round, players take turns making arguments for actions they wish to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Arguments:**\n",
    "   - Players describe their intended action, desired outcome, and provide a rationale.\n",
    "   - Arguments should be plausible and align with their faction's objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adjudication:**\n",
    "   - The Umpire evaluates each argument for plausibility, potential impact, and adherence to the game's narrative.\n",
    "   - Outcomes are determined based on the strength of the argument and the current game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resources:**\n",
    "   - Players have access to resources relevant to their division (e.g., military assets, economic leverage).\n",
    "   - Effective resource management influences the success of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tension Level:**\n",
    "   - The game tracks a \"Tension Level\" between EAST and WEST.\n",
    "   - Certain actions may increase or decrease the Tension Level.\n",
    "   - If the Tension Level reaches a critical point, it may trigger nuclear conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Conflict Resolution:**\n",
    "   - Conflicting actions are resolved by the Umpire, possibly using dice rolls to introduce uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Final Decision:**\n",
    "   - At the end of the game, the EAST Military Division decides whether to initiate nuclear conflict based on the Tension Level and game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Winning the Game:**\n",
    "   - There is no single winner; success is measured by how well factions achieve their objectives and prevent undesirable outcomes (e.g., nuclear war).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Umpire Role:**\n",
    "    - The Umpire ensures fair play and logical progression of the narrative.\n",
    "    - The Umpire may introduce events or information, including misinformation, to reflect the fog of war.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Communication:**\n",
    "    - Players may engage in diplomacy, form alliances, or share information during their turns.\n",
